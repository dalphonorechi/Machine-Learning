A \"ham\" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A \"spam\" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.\n","\n","You should create a function called `predict_message` that takes a message string as an argument and returns a list. The first element in the list should be a number between zero and one that indicates the likeliness of \"ham\" (0) or \"spam\" (1). The second element in the list should be the word \"ham\" or \"spam\", depending on which is most likely.\n","\n","For this challenge, you will use the [SMS Spam Collection dataset](http://www.dt.fee.unicamp.br/~tiago/smsspamcollection/). The dataset has already been grouped into train data and test data.\n","\n","The first two cells import the libraries and data. The final cell tests your model and function. Add your code in between these cells.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"8RZOuS9LWQvv"},"outputs":[],"source":["# import libraries\n","try:\n","  # %tensorflow_version only exists in Colab.\n","  !pip install tf-nightly\n","except Exception:\n","  pass\n","import tensorflow as tf\n","import pandas as pd\n","from tensorflow import keras\n","!pip install tensorflow-datasets\n","import tensorflow_datasets as tfds\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from wordcloud import WordCloud\n","import nltk\n","from nltk import word_tokenize\n","nltk.download('punkt')\n","import string\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer, TfidfTransformer\n","from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, GridSearchCV\n","from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier\n","from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix, accuracy_score\n","from sklearn.svm import SVC\n","from xgboost import XGBRegressor\n","\n","print(tf.__version__)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lMHwYXHXCar3"},"outputs":[],"source":["# get data files\n","!wget https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/sms/train-data.tsv\n","!wget https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/sms/valid-data.tsv\n","\n","train_file_path = \"train-data.tsv\"\n","test_file_path = \"valid-data.tsv\""]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train = pd.read_csv(train_file_path, sep='\\t', header=None, names=['label', 'message'])\n","df_test = pd.read_csv(test_file_path, sep='\\t', header=None, names=['label', 'message'])\n","df_test.head()"],"metadata":{"id":"JQkyruI3ZYq8"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Convert labels to categorical data and replace text with code values\n","\n","df_train['label'] = df_train['label'].astype('category').cat.codes\n","df_test['label'] = df_test['label'].astype('category').cat.codes"],"metadata":{"id":"yWX4RcPYZeNW"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Split data into labels and features\n","\n","train_features = df_train.copy()\n","test_features = df_test.copy()\n","train_labels = train_features.pop('label')\n","test_labels = test_features.pop('label')"],"metadata":{"id":"b7xOwY-UZikp"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_train['label'].value_counts().plot.bar();"],"metadata":{"id":"AF_mNzkSZnYq"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["df_len = pd.DataFrame(df_train)\n","df_len['length'] = df_len['message'].apply(len)\n","df_len.hist(column='length', by='label', bins=range(0, 1000, 10), figsize=(12,4));"],"metadata":{"id":"LkCkwwJbZuO5"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["ham_words = ' '.join(list(df_train[df_train['label'] == 0]['message']))\n","ham_wc = WordCloud(width=512, height=512).generate(ham_words)\n","plt.figure(figsize=(10,6), facecolor='k')\n","plt.imshow(ham_wc)\n","plt.axis('off')\n","plt.tight_layout(pad=0)\n","plt.show()"],"metadata":{"id":"8wk_cTBzZzdk"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Define function for message processing\n","def process_message(msg):\n","  #
